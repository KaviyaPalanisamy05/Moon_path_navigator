# Moon_path_navigator ðŸŒ‘ðŸš€
## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a safe and scientifically rich navigation route for a lunar rover on the Moon's south pole. Leveraging high-resolution optical and topographic data from the **Chandrayaan-2 mission**, the project identifies a 100-meter traverse path that:

- Begins at a specified landing site.
- Avoids obstacles like craters and boulders.
- Includes at least 10 stops for scientific investigations.

## Features

- **High-Resolution Data Analysis**: Utilizes datasets from Chandrayaan-2, including Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC), Digital Terrain Models (DTM), and more.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Identifies and avoids hazards like craters and boulders to ensure safe traversal.
- **Scientific Stops**: Incorporates 10+ stops for investigations into:
  - Water ice deposits
  - Geochemical and geological properties
  - Unique terrain features
- **Route Optimization**: Ensures the path is both scientifically rich and operationally feasible.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather high-resolution images and topographic data from Chandrayaan-2 mission archives.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Process the data using GIS tools to create detailed maps of the landing area.
3. **Obstacle Identification**:
   - Use machine learning and image processing to identify craters, boulders, and other obstacles.
4. **Route Planning**:
   - Develop an algorithm to find the optimal 100-meter path avoiding obstacles.
5. **Scientific Stop Selection**:
   - Analyze areas of interest and incorporate stops for maximum scientific exploration.
6. **Validation**:
   - Simulate the route to ensure feasibility and adherence to mission goals.
